# firstSeleniumAutomationTest
Hello,
This is my first test automation. I have written an automation using the "DemoQA" website, which is a demo site for testers. I have outlined the steps to be performed below:

1-Navigate to the website www.demoqa.com.
2-Go to the "Elements" section.
3-Navigate to the subheading "Web tables."
4-Click on the "Add" button on the displayed page.
5-Fill in all the information in the pop-up menu.
6-After filling in the information, click the "Submit" button.
7-Wait for 3 seconds, then close the page.
